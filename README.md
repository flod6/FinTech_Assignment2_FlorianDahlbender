# ComplAI AML Solutions
ComplAI is a modular FinTech solution that detects accounts involved in money laundering by leveraging **Graph Neural Networks** (GNNs) and **Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits** (CMABs) to identify suspects in real time. Implementing the GNN enables the exploitation of information in transaction networks, while CMAB's online learning capability allows it to adapt to new and evolving money laundering patterns. 

## Features
- Simulated transaction network generator with two realistic money laundering patterns (layering and smurfing)
- Pretrained GNN model using unsupervised learning to create embeddings
- Pretrained CMAB model to detect suspicious accounts using the embeddings generated by the GNN
- Streamlit UI for investigation of new suspicious accounts using new simulated data, updating the CMAB model based on the reviewed accounts, and monitoring of the CMAB performance
